---About---
The app aims to help school children engage in learning activities by guessing the national flags of countries around the world.

>>> The app displays national flags as options. Once players hit the "Start" button, 1 country will be selected randomly for players to choose its national flag.
>>> Players have a 3-guess limit, which is adjustable by an admin. A hint will be displayed for each wrong guess, and the chosen icon will be deactivated.
>>> A message box will be displayed each time players win or reach Max Guess.
>>> The Restart button can be used to start a new question at any time.
